## Recon
As always in order to solve any problem we must recon the problem and then understand it so that we can effectively write a solution.

## Checksec
Running checksec on the binary reveals that the binary has only nx enabled and hence it is quite easy to exploit.

## Static analysis
Opening the main function in radare2 we can see itâ€™s just calling pwnme function which seems vulnerable.

 `Main` Function :

`pwnme` Funtion :

`pwnme` function is reading input from stdin of size 50 meanwhile the buffer is of size 32 and 
 hence we have a classic buffer overflow vulnerability here and we can exploit it quite easily.
